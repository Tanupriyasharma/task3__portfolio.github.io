            <p>Hello, my name is Tanupriya Sharma and I am a recent computer science graduate. I have completed my BCA and am currently pursuing my MCA. While I have developed my skills in various programming languages including HTML, CSS, Python, and C.

                During my academic career, I worked on several projects including a shopping website, which helped me to gain practical experience and knowledge of software development. I enjoyed the process of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life.
                
                I am a quick learner, and always looking to improve my skills and knowledge. I am passionate about technology and how it can make a positive impact on the world. My goal is to work for a company that values innovation, creativity, and teamwork, and where I can apply my skills and learn new ones.
                
                Thank you for taking the time to read my "about me" section. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and I am looking forward to sharing my portfolio with you.</p>
